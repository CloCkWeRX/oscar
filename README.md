Oscar automatically adds things to your grocery list when you run out. You
just scan the item's barcode on its way into the trash.


Getting Started: Hardware
-----

I run Oscar on a [Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi) under [Raspbian](raspbian). I use
[this barcode scanner](scanner-amazon).

That said, there's no reason Oscar shouldn't work with other hardware.


Getting Started: Software
-----

To install Oscar, run the included `install.py` as root on the target system. It
will walk you through the process of setting up any API accounts you'll need, and
then it'll install the software.

I haven't really tested that install script, so let's cross our fingers together.
